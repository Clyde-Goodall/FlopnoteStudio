# Flopnote Studio

This is more or less just a pet project to capture and approximate the feel of the original Flipnote studio while learning Zig.

It's not functional in any meaningful way besids a simple canvas, so don't expect much yet or anytime soon. If you, reader, are versed in Zig (probably moreso than me) and this project interests you, I'd be more than happy to have contributors. 

Note that this isn't meant to be a 1:1 implementation of Flipnote, rather it is as many features that make sense for desktop, with a GUI that makes the most sense for desktop. There's a lot of work to be done here. For a more feature-complete and polished experience, try Clipnote Studio
